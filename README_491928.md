# Programming Assessment Readme

# Candidate number 491928

This file contains information on how to run the two scripts in R and Python which clean and merge two datasets and examines the relationship between various variables in the datasets.

The folder should include:

1. README_491928.txt
This is the current file
2. 491928_python.ipynb
This is the Python script in Jupyter notebooks.
3. 491928_rscript.R
This is the R script.
4. 491928_coversheet.doc
This is the coversheet for the assessment
5.requirements.txt
This includes the dependencies for the Python file
6. files folder
This includes the two datasets "births.csv" and "scores.csv" required to run the scripts.

After running the scripts you will end up with:

## For Python
1. 491928_dataset_python.xlsx
2. 491928_bweight_vs_gestwks_python.pdf 

## For R
1. 491928_dataset_R.csv
2. 491928_bweight_vs_gestwks_R.pdf


Please use Mac OS X or WSL.

## Getting started - Python

1. Download as a zip and unzip to local filesystem
2. Open the folder in terminal
3. Create new virtual environment eg `python -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment eg`source env/bin/      activate`
5. Install dependencies from the "requirements.txt" file `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run Jupyter Notebook `491928_python.ipynb` using this virtual environment

## Getting started - R

1. Install R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16) -- "Beagle Scouts"
2. Open `491928_rscript.R` in R Studio 2023.09.1 "Desert Sunflower"
3. Install the packages at the top of the script- comment out if already installed
